## Pros

We were warmly welcomed by the hosts. 
The apartment paid attention to many details, and the kitchen is equipped with everything you need 
for daily life. 
(Except for groceries ðŸ˜‰) We had a welcome basket with sparkling water, fruit, small snacks, and cookies. 
The other rooms (bathroom, bedroom, living room with Wi-Fi access, and a PC, large flat-screen TV) 
were all clean, with lovely little details. The hosts also checked in when we met outside to ensure 
everything was fine or if we needed information about the area. Very friendly overall. We felt very 
comfortable as a family.
