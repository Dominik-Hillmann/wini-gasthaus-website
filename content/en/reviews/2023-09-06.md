## Pros

Spacious house. Truly secluded. Shops within walking distance. Private outdoor space. 
Very well-equipped. We were with our dogs. They can be on the terrace but must be on a leash. 
It served as a stopover for us and certainly met our needs.

## Cons

The downside is showering in the bathtub, mainly because there's no support when getting out. 
I didn't want to pull up the (beautiful) shower curtain because it would leak too much outside the tub. 
The kitchen faucet initially provides hot water when you want cold, which is not convenient. 
I don't think it's properly connected. It continues to drip even after turning it off.
