## Pros

We really liked the apartment. It is furnished very elegantly 
with many personal items, making you feel at home right away.
We found everything we needed. The hosts live next door and are happy to assist.
The location was very convenient for trips to Magdeburg. It's a bit further for places like Quedlinburg, 
but still manageable.
It was pleasant to have plenty of green space in front of the house for dog walks. 
The dog waste bin is only 20 meters from the house, so you can dispose of your bags right away.

## Cons

The only slightly inconvenient thing was the shower in the bathtub. 
But that's nitpicking at a high level. 
It's perfectly manageable.
And the slightly longer distance to attractions like the Brocken, the Rübenhöhlen, Hexenplatz, etc.
