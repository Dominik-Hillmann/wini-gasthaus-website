clean and dry.

There are enough coasters and place mats to protect the surfaces (which can also be found under the table in the living

Most devices are self-explanatory, some operating instructions can be found in the cupboard above the microwave.

When showering, we kindly ask you to pull down the shower blind attached to the ceiling into the tub to prevent flooding
in the bathroom.

pulling it up again.
