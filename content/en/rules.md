## Kitchen/Bathroom

Please handle the kitchen equipment and technical devices with care. Since a dirty kitchen doesn't please anyone, please put dishes, pots, and cutlery in the cabinets only when they are clean and dry. Please do not place hot pots or other hot objects on tables or countertops without coasters. There are enough coasters and placemats to protect the surfaces. Always use a cutting board when cutting. Leave the interior of the oven, refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave in a clean state. All operating instructions (including those for the TV) are located in the cabinet above the microwave. 

For showering, we kindly ask you to pull down the shower curtain hanging from the ceiling into the tub to prevent flooding in the bathroom. To avoid mold and mildew, please ensure the curtain is adequately dried after showering before pulling it back up. Additionally, a hairdryer is available for your use.

## Damages

No one intentionally damages things. However, accidents can happen. We would appreciate it if you could report any damage immediately, rather than waiting until your departure for the final cleaning. This way, we can react quickly and, ideally, repair the damage during your stay for your continued use, or at least in time for the subsequent guests. Please contact us via email (mail@gasthaus-wini.com) or phone (contact details are available in the apartment). As a tenant, you are liable for damages up to the replacement value.

## Ventilation

To prevent mold formation, please ensure adequate ventilation of the rooms, at least 2 times per day for 10 minutes. Due to the small windows in the bathroom, special care is required here.

## Care

We ask you to treat the rental property with care and ensure that fellow travelers and family members also adhere to the rental conditions. The courtyard and entrance door should generally be closed to prevent potential damage from storms or break-ins (including windows). Use water, electricity, and heating resources conservatively.

## Disposal

It is mandatory to separate waste into residual waste, glass, paper, and packaging with the green dot. Containers with appropriate labels are available on the terrace. Please place empty glasses and glass bottles in the right side of the kitchen trash bin. Use trash and cosmetic bins only with trash bags and dispose of them in the residual waste bin, sealing them securely. Additional trash bags can be found in the kitchenette under the sink or in the bathroom cabinet.

Do not dispose of waste, food scraps, harmful liquids, or anything similar in the kitchen sink, toilet, sink, or shower! Avoid anything that can cause blockages in the pipes. All hygiene items must be disposed of in the residual waste.

## Cleaning

If an accident occurs (extreme dirt, spills on the floor or countertops, etc.), please clean it up immediately. You will find buckets, cleaning cloths, and a vacuum cleaner in the kitchenette, bottom right. We kindly ask you to leave the apartment in a swept-clean condition upon departure and to put all used dishes back in the cabinets clean. Dispose of your trash in the containers on the terrace; glass can remain in the kitchen trash bin. If particularly heavy soiling is present upon departure, additional cleaning costs will be charged based on effort. The cost of normal final cleaning is included in the rental price.

## Quiet Hours

In the interest of good neighborly relations, we ask you to observe public quiet hours, such as midday, night, and Sundays. Also, within the house, please maintain quiet between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM. Parties or events are not allowed!

## Internet/Wi-Fi

Free high-speed Wi-Fi is available in the apartment and on the terrace. You will receive the access code for your Wi-Fi-enabled devices upon arrival. You use the internet at your own risk. We disclaim any liability related to your internet usage. The use of internet access via Wi-Fi is subject to additional Wi-Fi usage rules. Please understand that we need to protect against misuse on your part; your consent is required at the time of booking.

## Smoking

Smoking is not allowed in the apartment! There are seating areas and an ashtray available on the terrace for this purpose. Please dispose of completely extinguished cigarette butts in the residual waste bin.

## Terrace

A seating area is provided for you on the terrace. You can find chair cushions in the bench in the hallway. We kindly ask you to bring them into the apartment in case of bad weather and generally overnight.

## Pets

The presence of up to two house-trained pets is allowed by prior arrangement (indicated during the booking process and subsequently confirmed). Please ensure that your pets do not use the seating, beds, or furniture. Pets must be leashed on the terrace.

## Parking

Parking is available directly in front of the house (at the hedge). Please be sure to keep the adjacent driveways and the intersection clear at all times. If you require additional parking spaces, please inform us during the booking process; we will assist you. The terrace can accommodate smaller mopeds/motorcycles and bicycles. The courtyard door from the street to the terrace is 1.10 meters wide. Please specify the number of parking spaces on the terrace when booking; these are free of charge.

## House Rules/Miscellaneous

Additional blankets and pillows are available in the apartment. These are intended for in-house use only, and we kindly ask you not to take them on your day trips or use them as picnic blankets on the terrace. We provide dish towels, towels, and bed linens for the duration of your stay. If needed, you can find additional towels in the top bathroom cabinet and dish towels in the kitchenette wall cabinet. Please simply place used towels on the bathroom floor before your departure. 

In the event of urgent repairs/emergencies, it may be necessary for us or authorized persons to enter the vacation rental without your knowledge/presence. We ask for your understanding.

A first-aid kit for emergency care can be found in the kitchenette, top right.

## Keys

The apartment is rented without physical keys. You will receive a 4-digit code shortly before your arrival, which will be valid for the duration of your stay. Enter this code at the entrance gate and the front door (both are the same) and confirm with the pound key (#). A signal tone will indicate that the door can be opened. Please remember this code and do not disclose it to others. Alternatively, you will find blue chips in the hallway that you can use for quicker door opening. Don't forget to leave these in the house upon departure, as we will have to charge â‚¬10 if they are not found.

If you forget the code or need assistance, please call us.

## Liability

We are not liable for your valuables. A safe is not available in the vacation rental.

## Check-In and Check-Out

Check-in is possible from 2:00 PM. On the day of departure, we kindly ask you to vacate the apartment no later than 11:00 AM in the condition described above.

## Cancellations

We hope you do not have to cancel your stay. However, if this does occur, the following cancellation fees apply upon withdrawal from the booking:

- Free until 2 months before the arrival date
- 50% up to 1 month before the arrival date
- 80% up to 14 days before the arrival date

Cancellations must be made by 12:00
